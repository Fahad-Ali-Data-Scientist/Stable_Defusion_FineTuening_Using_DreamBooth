# Stable Defusion Fine-Tuning Using DreamBooth

This project aims to fine-tune a stable diffusion model using **DreamBooth** to generate custom menu cards. The model is trained on a set of menu card images and is designed to create personalized menu cards based on the user's desired content, layout, and style.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to fine-tune a stable diffusion model using the DreamBooth technique so that the model can generate restaurant menu cards. These menu cards can be customized to fit various themes, cuisines, and preferences. 

The model learns the specific patterns, designs, and typography commonly seen in menu cards, and it is capable of producing high-quality, realistic menus based on the user’s input prompt.

## Features

- **DreamBooth Fine-Tuning**: Utilize the DreamBooth technique to fine-tune the pre-trained stable diffusion model with a custom dataset of menu cards.
- **Menu Customization**: Generate personalized menu cards by specifying items like the restaurant name, cuisine, dish descriptions, and other design aspects.
- **High-Quality Output**: Produce high-resolution menu card images suitable for real-world usage.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Diffusers library
- Huggingface Transformers library
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

To fine-tune the model, a dataset of menu cards is required. The dataset should consist of high-quality images of menu cards with various layouts, designs, and cuisines.

- Example formats: JPEG, PNG
- The dataset should ideally be labeled, specifying different categories such as "Restaurant Name," "Cuisine," "Dish Descriptions," etc.

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stable_Defusion_FineTuening_Using_DreamBooth.git
    cd Stable_Defusion_FineTuening_Using_DreamBooth
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download and prepare the dataset of menu cards (Ensure your dataset is stored in the `/data` directory).

4. Set up the model training using DreamBooth:

    - Pre-train your model or load a pre-trained stable diffusion model.
    - Fine-tune the model using the DreamBooth technique on the menu card dataset.
    
    For example:

    ```python
    from dreambooth import fine_tune
    fine_tune(dataset='/data/menu_cards', output_dir='/models/menu_card_model')
    ```

## Training

To start the fine-tuning process, use the following script:

```bash
python train.py --dataset /path/to/menu_card_images --output /path/to/save_model
```

This will train the stable diffusion model using the dataset and save the fine-tuned model at the specified location.

## Generation

Once the model is fine-tuned, you can generate custom menu cards by providing textual descriptions. The model will output menu cards based on your input.

To generate a menu card:

```python
from dreambooth import generate_image

prompt = "Italian restaurant menu with pasta, pizza, and salads"
image = generate_image(prompt=prompt, model_path='/path/to/saved_model')
image.show()
```

You can adjust the `prompt` to fit your needs and the generated menu card will be based on your specifications.

## Example Use Cases

- **Restaurant Branding**: Automatically create customized menu cards that reflect a restaurant’s unique theme and style.
- **Event Menus**: Generate menus for events such as weddings, banquets, or corporate gatherings.
- **Culinary Experimentation**: Quickly prototype different menu designs and styles.

## Model Output

The output will be a high-resolution image of a menu card based on the provided prompt. The design will reflect the elements learned during the fine-tuning phase, including fonts, colors, and layout, as seen in the dataset.
